            <li> I have been watching Dragon ball series for as long as I can remember. The first series, Dragon Ball, first aired on 
            February 26, 1986.There have been a total of 4 series, and about 640 episodes in total.</li>
            <li>A new series that started airing on July 5th, 2015</li>
            <li>Like the other Dragon Ball Series this one is about Goku, a saiyan, who seeks to be the strongest in the entire
            universe. Throughout his journey he has been going through intense training and fights.</li>
            <li>Latley Goku has achieve the strongest form possible and just has to master it. At the moment he is in a life-or-death battle 
            against arguably the strongest being we have seen yet.</li>
            <li>It has been confirmed that this series is ending on March 25th, 2018</li>

        <li>I have been watching one piece since 2009. One piece is a series of 827(as of 3/3/18) and is still continuing. </li>
        <li>One Piece has weekly episodes and continues to have weekly episode every Saturday Night, at apprximatly 6:30 p.m., and 
        their episodes matches their manga, which is like a comic book. The Manga is much further ahead of the episodes.</li>
        <li>One Piece is a series filled with a main conflict of Pirates and Revolutionaries against Marines(like police) and the 
        World Government. The Main character, Monkey D. Luffy, Luffy has a pirate crew of about 10 passionate, and strong people. They all aspire
        to be the best at something whether it's to be the best doctor, Swordsman, etc.  They are on a constant journey always fighting against 
        strong opponents on their way to the Final Island, Raftel, where they would discover what the greatest treasure, also known as the One Piece,
        is.</li>
        <li>In One Piece there are 4 extremely powerful Individuals who hold the title of Yonkou. These four claim islands and rule the "New World", and 
        they aren't usually messed with, until now. Luffy has challenged2 of these Yonkous to a battle, and the episodes are leading into where he fights the 
        first one.</li>
        <li>Honestly, One Piece has a long way until ending, although some say it'll have exactly 1,000 episode.</li>
